# video-player-java-javafx
SEM3 Mini Project in Java created by my 3 member team
The entire project is designed in Intellij Idea IDE using JAVA 8.
• The project contains three primary files:
    1. Main( )
    2. Controller( )
    3. Sample.fxml
• Main( ):- To launch the console application.
• Controller( ):- To assign controls/Properties to various buttons.
• Sample.fxml:- To design GUI of the application.

Front end implementation is done by using Scene Builder through which we can design the user
interface graphically by making changes to the .fxml file and then assign buttons to its functions with
ease.

• There are 5 primary buttons along with a volume slider and Time slider. The 5 buttons are
Backward, Play/Pause, Forward, backward, mute and screenshot .
• At the top of the window, a menu bar has been included which provides the user with 3 options
with sub options. The File Menu is used to open a dialogue box to select the media file, Tools
Menu has additional features like rotating the video, Restarting the video, Fast Forward and
Slow Motion .Help Menu is to get information about this application.
• And lastly to exit the application , the File Menu has an exit option which creates a pop up
dialog box to exit.Page.
